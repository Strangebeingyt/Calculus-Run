# Calculus Run
# A texture pack for Geometry Dash that includes random ass images and audio from my friends.

How to install
1. Right Click Geometry Dash on your Steam library then Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Backup your resources folder somewhere so you don't lose the original files. **(please.)**
3. Drag contents of "Resources" into the "Resources" folder in your local files in your GD Directory.
4. Replace the files in the destination and make sure you don't delete CCLocalLevels.dat!!
5. Open the game and see if it works, you'll know when it works. **Believe me.**

*This is a joke mod!*
